Made a dice simulator to go along with the "King Of New York" board game.  Rolling 6-8 IRL dice requires too much space, and often leads to knocking pieces on the board over, or dice falling on the floor.  Friend challenged me to make this.  Focus is on  mobile, due to phones being easier to use near the boardgame. First full completed side project.
